# Write a function that takes a list of sentences (a book) and returns a list of (word, word, avg_proximity) tuples
# where avg_proximity is the mean distance (as a float) between two words in all sentences in the entire book.
# Ordered by avg_proximity smallest to largest, word_1, word_2. In "The red house" the distance between the and house is one.

# Your results should be case insensitive and there should only be one tuple per word-word pair.
# The first word in the tuple should be the smallest alphanumerically out of the pair.
#
# Note that if two words never occured in the same sentence together,
# they will not be in a record together in the list.

# Note that one word can be in a sentence more than once.
